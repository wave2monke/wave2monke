👋 Hi, I’m @wave2monke
👀 I’m interested in cutting-edge technologies, open-source projects, and innovative software development practices. My passion lies in exploring the latest trends in AI, machine learning, and blockchain.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques and diving deeper into decentralized finance (DeFi) to understand how technology can further revolutionize finance and personal freedom.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on AI and blockchain, especially those aiming to make a positive impact on society. If you're working on something that can change the world for the better, I want to be a part of it.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me on GitHub @wave2monke. I'm always open to interesting discussions and new opportunities.
⚡ Fun fact: Despite my tech-focused life, I'm an avid surfer. Catching waves early in the morning is how I find balance and prepare for a day of coding and problem-solving.
